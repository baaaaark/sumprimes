    <h1>The sum of all primes: A prime number adding algorithm</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the prime number adder machine thingy!  
        In the world of computing, prime numbers are extremely tricky as there is no simple equation for a computer to find one, but we can make a program to do this for smaller numbers.</p> 
    <p> Type in a number and you will find out the sum of all prime numbers up to and including that number.  
        Please note this takes quite a bit of computer power so I would use numbers less than 1,000 until further optimization is made (It will probably crash your browser window) :-).</p>
