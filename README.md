Just a fun website that will give you every prime number between one and a user-inputed number, then adds them all together.
Identifying prime numbers is a difficult job for a computer.  As they follow no pattern there isn't really a way to "cheat" the
method needed to find out if a number is prime.  

Although I was able to reduce the number of iterations needed for each number to (basically) the square root of the number itself,
it still would be considered O^2 notation.  The design was an attempt to create a Commodore64 aesthetic.
